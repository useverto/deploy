# Commit style guide

## Why?
We value transparency and readability. Maintaining a consistent and clear structure of commits is a priority for us.

## How?
You can create a commit like this:
```sh
<type of update>(<updated file/component/feature>): <additional description>
```

### Type of the update
This can be any of the following items:
- feat
- fix
- remove
- refactor
- chore
- release

### Updated file/component/feature
To give more detail about your commit, declare the file or feature you updated.

For example:
- `index.html`
- `Button.svelte`
- `trade`
- `transaction`

### Additional description
State what you have changed or why you did it. It is your choice as long as you stay between from 1 to 50 characters.
